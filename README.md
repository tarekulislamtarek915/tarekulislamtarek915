Hi, I’m Tarekul Islam Tarek

I am a Frontend Web Developer with a strong foundation in modern web technologies.
 I am also a Political Scientist and Constitutional Expert, widely recognized for my work on the Living Constitution.

I am known for my exceptional command over constitutional texts. I am the only person in Bangladesh who has recited the entire Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh from memory in just 1 hour and 38 minutes, and the Proclamation of Independence of Bangladesh from memory in 5 minutes.

In 2010, I clearly articulated one of the most complex doctrines in political science—The Theory of Sovereignty (2010). Between 2010 and 2013, I developed and explained world-class theoretical frameworks on:

Law

Liberty

Equality

Public Opinion

Political Parties

Classification of Governments

Democracy and methods for its success

Decentralization

These works together form a World-Class Political Theory, currently awaiting publication in book form.

After Nathan Bond, a U.S. citizen, I am recognized as the only non-American in the world who can recite the entire Constitution of the United States from memory.
I also have extensive knowledge of the constitutions of Germany, France, Japan, Switzerland, and Denmark.
